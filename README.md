Welcome to Minesweeper Java Edition! This project was created back in 2021 as a personal attempt to enhance my skills in board representation, user interaction, and game logic in Java. 

Minesweeper Java Edition offers a classic gaming experience where players can reveal cells, flag potential mines, and strategically navigate the board to avoid hidden dangers.|
Check out the screenshot below to get a glimpse of the gameplay.
